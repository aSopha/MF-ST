I'm going through phaser right now and figuring out how it works.
(maybe) One day this will be a full fledged game

Ok so I've decided this will be a shoot-em-up game.
It'll have multiple levels with different enemies.
Some who charge at the player, some who shoot projectiles.
There's a shop where the player can spend the currency the enemies drop.

ToDo:

1. Score system
2. Add more enemies
3. Add different weapon types
4. Add actual sprites instead of these placeholders
