I'm going through phaser right now and figuring out how it and its arcade physics works. </br>
(maybe) One day this will be a full fledged game

</br>
Ok so I've decided this will be a shoot-em-up game.

 * It'll have multiple levels with different enemies.
 * Enemies will have different behaviors and characteristics
 * There's a shop where the player can spend the currency the enemies drop.

ToDo:

1. Add more enemies
2. Add different weapon types
3. Add actual sprites instead of these placeholders
